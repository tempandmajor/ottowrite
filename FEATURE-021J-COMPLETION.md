**Features**:
- ✅ SVG-based emotional intensity visualization
- ✅ Automatic emotion scoring from keywords
- ✅ Responsive with horizontal scroll
- ✅ Gradient fill area under curve
- ✅ Interactive data points
- ✅ Completion status color coding
- ✅ Grid lines and axis labels

**Emotion Scoring Algorithm**:
```typescript
95-100: ecstatic, triumphant, elated, euphoric
80-94:  happy, hopeful, optimistic, confident
70-79:  focused, determined, steady
55-69:  uncertain, conflicted, anxious
40-54:  worried, doubtful, afraid
25-39:  sad, defeated, exhausted
10-24:  shattered, devastated, hopeless
```

**Visual Features**:
- Line graph with smooth curves
- Colored gradient fill
- Data point markers
- X-axis: Stage labels
- Y-axis: Emotional intensity (0-100)
- Legend explaining indicators

---

### 3. API Integration
**File**: `app/api/characters/arcs/route.ts` (248 lines)

**Endpoints**:

#### GET /api/characters/arcs?character_id=...
- Fetch all arc stages for a character
- Ordered by stage_order ascending
- RLS security (user_id check)
- Returns: `{ arcStages: CharacterArcStage[] }`

#### POST /api/characters/arcs
- Create new arc stage
- Required: character_id, stage_name, stage_order
- Validates character ownership
- Returns: `{ arcStage: CharacterArcStage }`

#### PATCH /api/characters/arcs
- Update existing arc stage
- Required: id
- Prevents updating user_id, character_id
- Returns: `{ arcStage: CharacterArcStage }`

#### DELETE /api/characters/arcs?id=...
- Delete arc stage
- RLS security check
- Returns: `{ success: true }`

**Security**:
- All endpoints require authentication
- User can only access/modify their own arc stages
- Character ownership verification
- Input validation with error responses
- Structured logging for debugging

---

### 4. Database Schema
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251017000008_characters.sql`

**Table**: `character_arcs`

**Columns** (17 total):
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
- `character_id` (UUID, foreign key to characters)
- `stage_name` (TEXT)
- `stage_order` (INTEGER)
- `description` (TEXT)
- `location` (TEXT)
- `chapter_scene` (TEXT)
- `page_number` (INTEGER)
- `emotional_state` (TEXT)
- `beliefs` (TEXT)
- `relationships_status` (TEXT)
- `is_completed` (BOOLEAN, default false)
- `notes` (TEXT)
- `metadata` (JSONB)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

**RLS Policies** (4):
- Users can view their own character arcs (SELECT)
- Users can create their own character arcs (INSERT)
- Users can update their own character arcs (UPDATE)
- Users can delete their own character arcs (DELETE)

**Indexes** (3):
- `idx_arcs_user_id` - Performance for user queries
- `idx_arcs_character_id` - Performance for character queries
- `idx_arcs_stage_order` - Ordering performance
- `idx_arcs_completed` - Filter by completion status

**Constraints**:
- `unique_arc_stage` - Unique (character_id, stage_order) pairs

**Triggers**:
- Auto-update `updated_at` timestamp on UPDATE

---

### 5. Integration with Character Detail Page
**File**: `app/dashboard/projects/[id]/characters/[characterId]/page.tsx`

**Integration Points**:

1. **Lazy Loading** (lines 36-44):
   ```typescript
   const ArcTimeline = lazy(() =>
     import('@/components/characters/arc-timeline').then(mod => ({ default: mod.ArcTimeline }))
   )
   const ArcGraph = lazy(() =>
     import('@/components/characters/arc-graph').then(mod => ({ default: mod.ArcGraph }))
   )
   ```

2. **State Management** (lines 106-108):
   ```typescript
   const [arcStages, setArcStages] = useState<CharacterArcStage[]>([])
   const [arcLoading, setArcLoading] = useState(true)
   ```

3. **Data Fetching** (lines 173-187):
   - Loads arc stages on component mount
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Sets loading states

4. **CRUD Operations** (lines 198-262):
   - `handleCreateArcStage` - POST new stage
   - `handleUpdateArcStage` - PATCH existing stage
   - `handleDeleteArcStage` - DELETE stage

5. **UI Rendering** (lines 657-669):
   - "Story Arc" tab in character editor
   - ArcGraph component above timeline
   - ArcTimeline component with CRUD handlers
   - Suspense loading fallbacks

---

## Responsive Design

### Mobile-First Breakpoints

**Arc Timeline**:
- `sm:flex-row` - Header layout switches at small screens
- `sm:items-center` - Align items on small+ screens
- `sm:justify-between` - Justify content on small+ screens
- `sm:grid-cols-2` - 2-column grid for metadata on small+ screens
- `md:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]` - Asymmetric grid for dialog at medium screens
- `md:grid-cols-2` - 2-column grid for form fields at medium screens

**Arc Graph**:
- `w-full overflow-x-auto` - Horizontal scroll on small screens
- `min-w-full` - SVG minimum width ensures no shrinking
- `h-[260px]` - Fixed height for consistency
- `viewBox` attribute - SVG scales proportionally

**Character Detail Page**:
- `lg:grid-cols-[260px_1fr]` - Sidebar + content layout on large screens
- `lg:sticky lg:top-28` - Sticky sidebar on large screens
- Tab navigation adapts to mobile (TabsList component)

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**:
   - ArcTimeline and ArcGraph components lazy loaded
   - Reduces initial bundle size
   - Faster page load for character detail page

2. **Database Indexing**:
   - Indexes on user_id, character_id, stage_order
   - Fast queries even with many arc stages
   - Efficient filtering and ordering

3. **React Optimization**:
   - `useMemo` for sorted arcs (prevents re-sorting on every render)
   - `useCallback` for event handlers (stable references)
   - Suspense boundaries for loading states

4. **API Efficiency**:
   - Single query to fetch all stages
   - Ordered in database (not client-side)
   - Minimal payload size
