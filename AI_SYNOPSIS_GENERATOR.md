## Synopsis Best Practices (Implemented in AI Context)

### Industry Standards
```
1. Length: 500-3000 words depending on target (1-5 pages)
2. Tense: Present tense throughout (not past)
3. POV: Third person (even if book is first person)
4. Ending: MUST reveal the complete story including resolution
5. Structure: Chronological order with clear cause-and-effect
6. Focus: Main character's journey and transformation
7. Tone: Professional and straightforward (not marketing copy)
8. Details: Use character names, specific plot points
9. Content: Major turning points, character motivations, stakes
10. Exclusions: No questions, no cliffhangers, no teasing
```

### Synopsis Structure
```
Opening Paragraph:
- Introduce protagonist and setting
- Establish initial situation
- Present the status quo before disruption

Middle Paragraphs (in chronological order):
- Inciting incident that disrupts the protagonist's world
- Major obstacles and complications (rising action)
- Midpoint revelation or major turning point
- Escalating conflicts and character development
- Include major subplots that affect main story

Final Paragraph:
- Climax - final confrontation or critical decision
- Resolution - how the story ends
- Character transformation - how protagonist has changed
```

### What to Include
```
✓ Protagonist's goal, motivation, and internal conflict
✓ Main antagonist and their role/motivation
✓ Major plot twists and revelations
✓ Key supporting characters (if they affect plot)
✓ Emotional journey and character growth
✓ Complete ending and resolution
✓ Cause-and-effect relationships
✓ Stakes - what happens if protagonist fails
```

### What to Exclude
```
✗ Minor characters that don't affect main plot
✗ Excessive world-building details
✗ Chapter-by-chapter breakdown
✗ Marketing hooks or teaser language
✗ Rhetorical questions
✗ Cliffhangers or "read to find out" language
✗ Author's opinion about the story
✗ Generic descriptions - be specific
```

## Synopsis Length Guidelines

### Short Synopsis (1 page)
```
Word Count: 500-750 words
Token Limit: 1200
Use Case: Quick submissions, initial queries
Content: Main plot only, key turning points
Structure: 3-5 paragraphs
Focus: Protagonist's journey, central conflict, resolution
```

### Medium Synopsis (2 pages) - **Default**
```
Word Count: 1000-1500 words
Token Limit: 2400
Use Case: Standard submissions to agents/publishers
Content: Main plot + major subplots, character arcs
Structure: 6-10 paragraphs
Focus: Complete story with character development
```

### Long Synopsis (3-5 pages)
```
Word Count: 2000-3000 words
Token Limit: 4800
Use Case: Detailed submissions, film/TV pitches
Content: Full plot, all subplots, complete character development
Structure: 12-20 paragraphs
Focus: Comprehensive story breakdown with all details
```

## Form Integration

### User Flow

```
1. User fills out manuscript details (Step 1)
2. User navigates to Synopsis step (Step 3)
3. User writes brief story description (100+ characters)
4. User sees "Expand with AI" button
5. User clicks button
6. System validates:
   - Manuscript details are complete
   - Story description exists and is ≥100 characters
7. If valid:
   - Button shows "Generating..."
   - Button becomes disabled
   - API call to /api/submissions/generate-synopsis
   - Synopsis field replaces with full AI-generated synopsis
   - Button returns to "Expand with AI"
8. If error:
   - Error message displayed to user
   - User can retry or continue editing manually
```

### Button Behavior

```typescript
Button Label: "Expand with AI" (not "Generate" like query letter)
Reasoning: Emphasizes that user provides seed, AI expands it

Disabled when:
- No story description provided
- Story description < 100 characters
- Currently generating (generatingSynopsis === true)

Labels:
- Default: "Expand with AI"
- Loading: "Generating..."

Icon: Sparkles (from lucide-react)
```

### Validation Requirements

Before generation, form validates:
```typescript
1. title: Must be non-empty string
2. genre: Must be non-empty string
3. word_count: Must be valid number > 0
4. type: Must be valid ManuscriptType
5. storyDescription (synopsis field): Must be ≥100 characters
```

If validation fails, error message shown:
- "Please complete the manuscript details before generating a synopsis"
- "Please provide a brief story description (minimum 100 characters) to generate a full synopsis"

## Service Architecture

## AI Model Configuration

### Why Claude Sonnet 4.5?

```
Chosen for synopsis generation because:
✓ Excellent at maintaining present tense consistently
✓ Strong narrative structure understanding
✓ Detailed plot summary capabilities
✓ Good at revealing endings (not cliffhangers)
✓ Understands cause-and-effect relationships
✓ Natural, professional prose
✓ Follows complex instructions well
✓ Respects word count targets

Alternative models available:
- GPT-5: Good alternative, slightly less creative
- DeepSeek: Cost-effective for bulk, but less nuanced
```

### Cost Analysis

```
Synopsis Generation Cost (Claude Sonnet 4.5):

Short Synopsis (750 words):
Input tokens: ~1200 (context + prompt)
Output tokens: ~1200 (750 words)
Cost: (1200/1M × $3) + (1200/1M × $15) = $0.0216

Medium Synopsis (1500 words):
Input tokens: ~1200
Output tokens: ~2400
Cost: (1200/1M × $3) + (2400/1M × $15) = $0.0396

Long Synopsis (3000 words):
Input tokens: ~1200
Output tokens: ~4800
Cost: (1200/1M × $3) + (4800/1M × $15) = $0.0756

Annual cost for active Studio user:
- Avg 5 synopsis generations/year (testing + final)
- Avg length: medium
- Cost: $0.20/year per user
- Negligible compared to $49/month subscription
```

### Context Engineering

The AI context is engineered to produce publishing-ready synopses:

```typescript
1. Role Definition
   - Literary consultant specializing in synopses
   - Deep understanding of submission standards
   - Knowledge of agent/publisher expectations

2. Best Practices (15 Guidelines)
   - Always present tense
   - Reveal complete plot including ending
   - Focus on protagonist's journey
   - Include major plot points
   - Show cause-and-effect
   - Character motivations
   - Include key subplots
   - Chronological order
   - Specific names (not "the protagonist")
   - Show stakes
   - Third person even if book is first person
   - Focused paragraphs
   - Active voice, strong verbs
   - No rhetorical questions
   - Professional tone

3. Length Guidelines
   - Specific word count ranges
   - When to use each length
   - Content depth for each

4. Structure Template
   - Opening: protagonist, setting, situation
   - Inciting incident
   - Rising action with obstacles
   - Midpoint revelation
   - Climax
   - Resolution and character transformation

5. Content Filters
   - What to include (clear lists)
   - What to exclude (clear lists)
   - Helps AI make good decisions
```

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
```typescript
✓ Full TypeScript throughout
✓ Request/response types defined
✓ Validation functions typed
✓ Length enum type-safe
✓ No 'any' types used
✓ Strict null checks
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
✓ Try-catch blocks for AI calls
✓ Validation before generation
✓ Output quality validation
✓ Specific error messages
✓ User-friendly error display
✓ No silent failures
```

### Code Organization
```typescript
✓ Service layer separated from API
✓ Reusable generation functions
✓ Single responsibility functions
✓ Helper functions for analysis
✓ Clear function naming
✓ Comprehensive comments
```

## Quality Assurance

### Output Validation

The system validates generated synopses for:

**1. Word Count**
```typescript
Checks if synopsis falls within target range:
- Short: 400-900 words
- Medium: 900-1700 words
- Long: 1700-3500 words

Warns if outside range (but doesn't reject)
```

**2. Tense Compliance**
```typescript
Heuristic check for excessive past tense:
- Counts common past tense words (was, were, had, etc.)
- Flags if > 10% of words are past tense
- Synopsis should be present tense

Note: Simple heuristic, not perfect
```

**3. Question Detection**
```typescript
Checks for question marks in text:
- Synopses should not contain questions
- Questions indicate teasing/cliffhanger language
- Professional synopses make statements
```

**4. Cliffhanger Language**
```typescript
Detects common cliffhanger phrases:
- "will they..."
- "can they..."
- "find out..."
- "discover what happens..."
- "read to find out..."

These indicate synopsis isn't revealing ending
```

### Quality Check Response

All quality issues returned to client:
```json
"metadata": {
  "qualityCheck": {
    "valid": true,
    "issues": []
  }
}
```

Or if issues found:
```json
"metadata": {
  "qualityCheck": {
    "valid": false,
    "issues": [
      "Synopsis may contain excessive past tense (should be present tense)",
      "Synopsis should reveal the ending, not tease it"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Unit Tests (Future)

```typescript
describe('Synopsis Generator', () => {
  describe('validateSynopsisRequest', () => {
    it('validates required fields')
    it('checks minimum description length')
    it('validates word count is positive')
    it('validates target length enum')
    it('returns error messages for invalid data')
  })

  describe('generateSynopsis', () => {
    it('generates short synopsis')
    it('generates medium synopsis')
    it('generates long synopsis')
    it('includes subplots when requested')
    it('excludes subplots when requested')
    it('handles AI generation errors')
    it('returns usage statistics')
  })

  describe('validateSynopsisOutput', () => {
    it('validates word count for short synopsis')
    it('validates word count for medium synopsis')
    it('validates word count for long synopsis')
    it('detects excessive past tense')
    it('detects questions')
    it('detects cliffhanger language')
  })

  describe('analyzeStoryDescription', () => {
    it('detects protagonist')
    it('detects conflict')
    it('detects ending')
    it('estimates completeness')
  })
})
```

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time Breakdown
```
Short Synopsis (750 words):
- AI generation: 8-12 seconds
- Validation: < 100ms
- Total: 8-12 seconds

Medium Synopsis (1500 words):
- AI generation: 12-20 seconds
- Validation: < 100ms
- Total: 12-20 seconds

Long Synopsis (3000 words):
- AI generation: 20-35 seconds
- Validation: < 100ms
- Total: 20-35 seconds

Timeout: 60 seconds (safe buffer for all lengths)
```

### Caching Strategy (Future)
```
Could implement caching for:
- Similar story descriptions → similar synopses
- Synopsis templates by genre
- Common story structures

Trade-off: Uniqueness vs. speed
Decision: No caching (each synopsis should be unique)
Reasoning: Agents can detect generic synopses
```

### Token Optimization
```
Context is ~800 tokens (reusable)
Prompt varies by story description length
Output capped by target length

Could optimize:
- Compress context (trade detail for tokens)
- Cache context embeddings
- Use shorter prompts

Current approach prioritizes quality over token efficiency
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
```
✓ Server-side authentication check
✓ Studio subscription verification
✓ User ID tracked in all operations
✓ No client-side API key exposure
✓ Rate limiting recommended for production
```

### Input Validation
```
✓ All inputs validated before AI call
✓ Description length limits (prevent abuse)
✓ Genre from predefined list
✓ Manuscript type from enum
✓ Target length enum validation
✓ Boolean sanitization
```

### Output Safety
```
✓ AI output used as-is (synopses are safe content)
✓ No code execution from AI output
✓ XSS protection via React (auto-escaped)
✓ No SQL/command injection possible
✓ Quality validation catches malformed output
```

## User Experience

### Discoverability
```
✓ Prominent "Expand with AI" button
✓ Different label from Query Letter ("Expand" vs "Generate")
✓ Sparkles icon indicates AI feature
✓ Button positioned next to label
✓ Clear button text
✓ Disabled state when unusable
```

### Feedback
```
✓ Loading state during generation
✓ Error messages for failures
✓ Success: Auto-replaced textarea
✓ Visual feedback (button state changes)
✓ Word count estimate in response
✓ Quality check results available
```

### Flexibility
```
✓ User provides seed, AI expands
✓ User can edit after generation
✓ User can regenerate if unsatisfied
✓ User can write manually instead
✓ User can expand their own partial synopsis
✓ Three length options available
✓ Subplot inclusion toggle
```
