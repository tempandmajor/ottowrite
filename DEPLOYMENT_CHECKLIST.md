- Storage bucket uses existing settings

### 4. Dependencies

**Status**: ✅ INSTALLED

New dependencies added:
```json
{
  "d3": "^7.x.x",
  "@types/d3": "^7.x.x",
  "framer-motion": "^10.x.x",
  "@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog": "^1.x.x",
  "@radix-ui/react-tabs": "^1.x.x"
}
```

All installed via `npm install` and committed to package-lock.json

### 5. Custom Domain Re-alias

**Status**: ✅ REQUIRED FOR EACH RELEASE

- [ ] Promote the latest deployment in Vercel or note its build id.
- [ ] In Vercel → Project Settings → Domains, remove `www.ottowrite.app`.
- [ ] Re-add `www.ottowrite.app` so it points at the latest deployment.
- [ ] Wait 1–2 minutes, then confirm `https://www.ottowrite.app/dashboard` returns 401 when unauthenticated.
- [ ] If caching persists, purge the CDN for the domain and re-check.
- Tip: run `scripts/refresh-domain-alias.sh www.ottowrite.app` after setting `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_URL`.

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (Within 1 hour)

- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/projects/[id]/world-building`
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Create a test location
- [ ] Add a test timeline event
- [ ] Upload a test image
- [ ] Filter by category
- [ ] Search for location
- [ ] Delete test data
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify no API errors in logs

### Monitoring (First 24 hours)

- [ ] Monitor error logs in Vercel
- [ ] Check Supabase logs for query errors
- [ ] Watch for RLS policy violations
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Track storage usage (image uploads)
- [ ] Check for any 500 errors
- [ ] Verify mobile usage works

### Performance Checks

- [ ] Page load time < 2s on desktop
- [ ] Page load time < 3s on mobile
- [ ] Filter/search responds < 100ms
- [ ] Location creation < 1s
- [ ] Event creation < 1s
- [ ] Image upload < 5s (for 5MB file)

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

### Quick Rollback (Code)

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert 4a419f2
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy previous version
```

### Database Rollback (if needed)

```sql
-- Remove tables (only if absolutely necessary)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.location_events CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.locations CASCADE;

-- Remove functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_location_events_updated_at();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_locations_updated_at();
```

**Note**: Database rollback will lose any user-created location data.
Only perform if migration caused critical errors.

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Timeline View**: List-based, not visual timeline
   - Future: Horizontal timeline UI with date markers

2. **No Map Integration**: No geographical visualization
   - Future: Interactive map view with location pins

3. **No Character Links**: Locations don't link to characters
   - Future: Track which characters have been to which locations

4. **Basic Search**: Text-only, no fuzzy matching
   - Future: Advanced search with filters, tags, fuzzy matching

5. **No Templates**: Users start from scratch
   - Future: Location templates (tavern, castle, spaceship, etc.)

6. **No Export**: Can't export location data
   - Future: Export to PDF, markdown, JSON

### Workarounds

**Need visual timeline?**
- Use external tools like Aeon Timeline
- List events in timeline view by chapter/date

**Need map view?**
- Use external tools like Wonderdraft, Inkarnate
- Upload map as image to location

**Need character links?**
- Mention characters in event descriptions
- Use tags to track character presence

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Next Sprint)
- Visual timeline UI
- Location templates
- Enhanced search

### Phase 2 (Q1 2026)
- Map integration
- Character-location links
- Location hierarchies

### Phase 3 (Q2 2026)
- Export functionality
- Import from other tools
- AI-powered location generation
