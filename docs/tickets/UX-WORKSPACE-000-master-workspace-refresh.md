# UX-WORKSPACE-000: Master Tracking - Document Workspace Refresh

**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: Large (15-18 hours total)
**Impact**: Very High - Transforms workspace to match industry standards
**Status**: In Progress

---

## Overview

This master ticket tracks the comprehensive refresh of the document workspace to match professional word processor standards (Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Final Draft, Scrivener).

**Research Date**: 2025-01-24
**Research Source**: Comparative analysis of Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Final Draft, and Scrivener

---

## Problem Statement

Current OttoWrite workspace has several issues:
1. Too many sidebars (Binder + Outline + AI) creates cognitive overload
2. No quick layout switching (users must manually toggle each sidebar)
3. Toolbar not as clean as Google Docs (visible complexity)
4. Grid complexity makes maintenance difficult
5. Analytics always visible (mental distraction)

**User Feedback**: "The document workspace still looks like not much has changed. [It] does not look standard and it is cluttered."

---

## Sub-Tickets (Implementation Order)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (HIGH PRIORITY)
These provide maximum impact with reasonable effort:

1. **UX-WORKSPACE-007: Add Quick Layout Presets** (3-4 hours)
   - Status: Not Started
   - Four preset layouts: Writer, Planner, Assistant, Full
   - Keyboard shortcuts for instant switching
   - Saves state in localStorage
   - **Impact**: Dramatically improves discoverability and ease of use

2. **UX-WORKSPACE-009: Simplify Toolbar** (2-3 hours)
   - Status: Not Started
   - Remove "Actions" dropdown
   - Keep only: Back, Undo/Redo, Command Palette, Focus Mode
   - Move all secondary actions to Command Palette
   - **Impact**: Makes interface feel immediately more professional

3. **UX-WORKSPACE-008: Consolidate Sidebars** (4-5 hours)
   - Status: Not Started
   - Merge Binder into Outline sidebar as "Documents" tab
   - Reduce from 3 sidebars to 2 (Outline left, AI right)
   - Simplify grid layout significantly
   - **Impact**: Reduces clutter, simplifies UI significantly

### Phase 2: Polish (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
These improve maintainability and refinement:

4. **UX-WORKSPACE-010: Hide Analytics by Default** (2 hours)
   - Status: Not Started
   - Remove sticky bottom status bar
   - Add "Analytics" button in toolbar (opens drawer on demand)
   - Keep essential info in Command Palette
   - **Impact**: Cleaner interface, less distraction

5. **UX-WORKSPACE-011: Simplify Grid Layout** (3-4 hours)
   - Status: Not Started
   - Replace complex grid with flexbox
   - Add draggable panel resizing
   - Eliminate 9 grid configuration conditionals
   - **Impact**: Better maintainability, smoother UX

## Migration Plan

### Backward Compatibility
1. **Existing workspace state**: Migrate old sidebar states to new preset system
2. **User preferences**: Map old preferences to closest preset
3. **Default behavior**: If no saved state, default to "Writer" preset

### Migration Script
```typescript
// Run on first load after update
function migrateWorkspaceState() {
  const old = localStorage.getItem('workspace-state')
  if (!old) return 'writer' // New user

  const state = JSON.parse(old)

  // Map old state to new preset
  if (!state.showBinder && !state.showOutline && !state.showAI) {
    return 'writer'
  } else if (state.showOutline && !state.showAI) {
    return 'planner'
  } else if (state.showAI && !state.showOutline) {
    return 'assistant'
  } else {
    return 'full'
  }
}
```

### Rollout Plan
1. **Week 1**: Deploy Phase 1 tickets (Layout Presets, Clean Toolbar, Consolidate Sidebars)
2. **Week 2**: Monitor user feedback, fix bugs
3. **Week 3**: Deploy Phase 2 tickets (Hide Analytics, Simplify Grid)
4. **Week 4**: Final polish and optimization

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. **Immediate rollback**: Revert to previous Git commit
2. **Partial rollback**: Disable individual features via feature flags
3. **Data migration rollback**: Restore old localStorage schema

Feature flags to add:
- `ENABLE_LAYOUT_PRESETS` (default: true)
- `ENABLE_CONSOLIDATED_SIDEBAR` (default: true)
- `ENABLE_CLEAN_TOOLBAR` (default: true)

## Notes

### Design Inspiration
- **Google Docs**: Clean toolbar, hidden complexity
- **Microsoft Word**: Tabbed ribbon (inspiration for layout presets)
- **Final Draft**: Customizable panels, focus modes
- **Scrivener**: 7 preset layouts, 3-pane organization

### Key Design Decisions
1. **4 presets vs. 7**: Start with 4 common patterns, add more based on usage
2. **Consolidate to 2 sidebars**: Reduces complexity while maintaining functionality
3. **Analytics on-demand**: Matches Google Docs pattern of hiding metrics
4. **Flexbox over grid**: Simpler codebase, easier drag-and-drop later

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)
- Customizable toolbar (let users add/remove buttons)
- Draggable panel resizing (Scrivener-style)
- More than 4 layout presets
- Per-document layout preferences
- Collaborative layout sharing
