# What's New in OttoWrite v0.5.0 ‚ú®

**Release Date**: October 20, 2025
**Focus**: Editor Intelligence & Workflow Enhancements

---

## üéØ Overview

Version 0.5.0 brings powerful new intelligence features to your editor experience. Track document metadata, get instant reading insights, discover characters and scenes automatically, and let AI help you write with smart content insertion at your cursor‚Äîexactly where you need it.

---

## üÜï New Features

### üìù Document Metadata Tracking

**Never lose track of your story's perspective and tone again.**

Define key metadata for every document to maintain consistency across your writing:

- **POV Character**: Track which character's perspective drives the narrative
- **Pacing Target**: Set your desired rhythm (Slow, Balanced, or Fast)
- **Tone**: Define the emotional atmosphere (e.g., "dark," "humorous," "suspenseful")

**Where to find it**: Click the metadata button in your editor's header

**What happens**: Metadata saves automatically with your document and displays as badges in your chapter sidebar for quick reference.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Live Reading Time & Pacing Insights

**See how your story flows in real-time.**

A new widget in your editor's left sidebar gives you instant feedback:

- **Reading Time**: Based on industry-standard 250 words per minute
- **Words per Chapter**: Average distribution across your structure
- **Pacing Gauge**: Visual indicator showing if your pacing is Fast, Balanced, or Slow
  - **Fast**: Less than 2,000 words per chapter (quick, punchy)
  - **Balanced**: 2,000-4,000 words per chapter (standard novel pacing)
  - **Slow**: Over 4,000 words per chapter (literary, detailed)

**Why it matters**: Adjust your pacing in real-time to match your genre and audience expectations.

### üë• Character & Scene Index

**Instantly find who appears where in your story.**

Two powerful new index tabs in your sidebar:

#### **Characters Tab**
- Automatically detects character names from dialogue and prose
- Shows each character's:
  - Total scene count
  - Line/appearance count
  - Last appearance (with jump-to link)
- Click any character to navigate to their most recent scene

#### **Scenes Tab**
- Parses screenplay-style scene headings (INT/EXT)
- Displays:
  - Scene type (Interior, Exterior, or Int/Ext)
  - Location
  - Time of day
  - Character count per scene
- Click any scene to jump directly to it in your document

**How it works**: The index updates automatically as you write. No manual tagging required!

### ü§ñ Enhanced AI Writing Commands

**Six powerful commands to accelerate your writing.**

All AI commands now route correctly to the backend with full validation:

1. **Continue** ‚ûú Extend your scene with consistent voice and pacing
2. **Rewrite** ‚ûú Polish prose for clarity and emotional impact
3. **Shorten** ‚ûú Tighten text by ~30% while keeping plot beats intact
4. **Expand** ‚ûú Add sensory details and grounding to enrich scenes
5. **Tone Shift** ‚ûú Adjust emotional temperature (increase tension, lighten mood, etc.)
6. **Brainstorm** ‚ûú Generate "what if" variations to explore new directions

**New**: Each command comes with default prompt templates. Save your own custom templates for reusable writing instructions!

**Where to find it**: AI Assistant panel in your editor

### üéØ Cursor-Aware Content Insertion

**AI inserts exactly where your cursor is‚Äînot at the end of the document.**

This was a highly requested feature. Now when AI generates content:

**For Prose Documents**:
- Inserts at your current cursor position
- Replaces selected text if you've highlighted anything
- Supports multi-line insertions
- Handles Unicode and special characters

**For Screenplay Documents**:
- Inserts within the current element at cursor position
- Creates new elements for multi-paragraph AI responses
- Respects element boundaries (dialogue, action, etc.)

**How to use it**:
1. Place your cursor where you want AI content
2. (Optional) Select text to replace it
3. Use any AI command
4. Click "Insert into Editor"
5. Content appears exactly where you wanted it ‚ú®

**Testing**: This feature passed 17 automated tests covering edge cases like empty documents, special characters, and Unicode.

## üîß Improvements

### Editor Performance
- **Real-time Updates**: All widgets use optimized rendering (React's useMemo)

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Maximize the Metadata System
- **POV Character**: Great for switching perspectives in multi-POV novels
- **Pacing Target**: Set to "Fast" for thrillers, "Slow" for literary fiction
- **Tone**: Use descriptive words like "noir," "whimsical," or "gritty"

### Use the Pacing Widget
- **Green (Balanced)**: You're in the sweet spot for most genres
- **Orange (Fast)**: Perfect for YA, thrillers, or action scenes
- **Blue (Slow)**: Ideal for literary fiction or world-building chapters

### Character Index Pro Tips
- **Screenplay**: Use "CHARACTER:" format for reliable detection
- **Prose**: Use all-caps for first mention (e.g., "SARAH walked in")
- **Navigation**: Click "Last seen" to jump to a character's most recent appearance

### AI Command Workflow
1. **Draft** with "Continue" command
2. **Refine** with "Rewrite" or "Shorten"
3. **Enhance** with "Expand" for sensory details
4. **Adjust** with "Tone Shift" to match your target mood
5. **Explore** with "Brainstorm" when you're stuck

### Custom Templates
- Save frequently-used AI prompts as templates
- Group templates by command type
- Share templates with your writing group (export feature coming soon!)

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Data Storage**: All metadata stored within your document's JSONB content field
- **User-Scoped**: Row-level security ensures you only see your own data
- **No New Tables**: Zero database schema changes for this release
- **Backward Compatible**: Old documents work without modification

---

## üêû Known Issues

### Pending Manual QA
- Basic editing smoke tests pending (typing, formatting)

- Conflict resolution UI requires multi-user testing

### Future Enhancements
- E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows
- Performance testing with large documents (10k+ words, 50+ chapters)
- Browser compatibility verification (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsiveness for editor widgets
