## Tips & Best Practices

### Start Small
Don't try to map your entire world at once. Start with:
1. The starting location
2. 2-3 key destinations
3. Add more as your story develops

### Use Consistent Details
Reference your location notes when writing to maintain consistency in:
- Geography (distances, climate)
- Culture (customs, language)
- History (who founded it, major events)

### Link to Characters
In event descriptions, mention which characters were involved. This helps you:
- Track character movements
- Find plot connections
- Maintain timeline consistency

### Update as You Write
When something important happens in your story:
1. Add it as a timeline event
2. Update the location's summary if needed
3. Adjust tags to reflect new status

### Export Your Data
Periodically export your world-building data (feature coming soon) to:
- Back up your work
- Share with beta readers
- Create reference documents

## Keyboard Shortcuts
