  - Links to projects
  - Stores premise and generated content
  - Full RLS policies

### 2. AI Generation Service âœ…
**File:** `lib/ai/outline-generator.ts`

#### Capabilities:
- **Multiple Formats:**
  - **Chapter Summary:** Chapter-by-chapter with plot points and targets
  - **Scene-by-Scene:** Detailed scene breakdown with locations/objectives
  - **Treatment:** Narrative prose outline (screenplay style)

  - Incorporates existing content if provided

- **Structured Output:**
  ```typescript
  {
    type: 'chapter' | 'scene' | 'act' | 'sequence',
    order: number,
    title: string,
    description: string,
    notes?: string,
    wordCountTarget?: number,

  }
  ```

#### Target Guidelines by Project Type:
- **Screenplay:** 90-120 pages, 40-60 scenes

## Technical Implementation

### AI Prompt Engineering

Each format has a specialized prompt that guides Claude 4.5 to generate appropriate content:

**Example: Chapter Summary Prompt**
```
Generate a chapter-by-chapter outline. For each chapter, provide:
- Chapter number and title
- Brief description (2-3 sentences) of what happens
- Key plot points and character developments
- Approximate word count target (based on typical chapter length)

Structure each chapter to advance the story while maintaining pacing.
```

### Security

- API keys stored securely in Vercel environment variables
- All database operations use RLS
- User authentication required
- Project ownership verified
- No client-side API key exposure

### Performance

- 60-second timeout for AI generation
- Optimized database queries with indexes
- Lazy loading of outline content
- Responsive UI with loading states

---

## Usage Workflow

### For Writers:

1. **Navigate to Project**
   - Open any project in OttoWrite

2. **Click "AI Outlines"**
   - Access from project detail page

3. **Generate Outline**
   - Click "Generate Outline"
   - Choose format (chapter summary, scene-by-scene, etc.)
   - Enter story premise (2-4 sentences)
   - Optionally add context (themes, arcs, specific elements)
   - Click "Generate Outline"

4. **Wait for AI**
   - Claude 4.5 analyzes premise
   - Generates comprehensive outline (20-40 seconds)
