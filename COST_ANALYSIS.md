| Professional | $12.00 | 80.0% | -10.7% |
| Studio | $48.00 | 52.0% | -40.7% |

**Mitigation**:
- Overage fees: $1 per 10K words beyond limit
- Auto-upgrade prompts at 80% usage
- Soft limits with upgrade incentives

### Scenario 2: AI Costs Decrease (Optimistic)

Assumptions:
- DeepSeek gains traction (60% usage)
- OpenAI/Anthropic reduce prices by 30%
- Blended cost: $0.008/1K words

| Professional | $4.00 | 93.3% | +2.6% |
| Studio | $16.00 | 84.0% | -8.7% |

**Strategy**: Pass 50% of savings to customers, retain 50% as margin expansion

### Scenario 3: Scale Efficiencies (10,000+ Users)

At 10,000+ paid users:
- Infrastructure cost per user: -40% (volume discounts)
- Support cost per user: -30% (automation, knowledge base)
- Operations cost per user: -50% (economies of scale)

**Estimated Margin Improvement**: +8-12% across all tiers
