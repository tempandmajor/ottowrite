- **Anonymous Access:** ✅ Properly restricted

---

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Automated SQL Verification

Created comprehensive SQL test suite (`supabase/tests/verify-rls-policies.sql`) that checks:
- RLS enabled on all critical tables
- Policy count and coverage by table
- Tables with RLS but no policies (orphaned tables)
- Specific RLS policy patterns for user isolation
- Overly permissive policies
- Summary statistics

### 2. TypeScript Test Suite

Created automated test suite (`scripts/verify-rls-policies.ts`) that tests:
- Anonymous user access restrictions
- Authenticated user data isolation
- Collaborator access to shared resources
- Project member permissions
- Document access control
- AI usage data isolation
- Manuscript submission privacy

### 3. Tables Tested

**Critical Tables (12 core tables):**
- ✅ `user_profiles` - User account data
- ✅ `projects` - User projects
- ✅ `documents` - Project documents and content
- ✅ `ai_usage` - AI service usage tracking
- ✅ `api_requests` - API request logs
- ✅ `manuscript_submissions` - Manuscript submissions
- ✅ `partner_submissions` - Partner submission responses
- ✅ `user_legal_agreements` - Legal document agreements
- ✅ `document_versions` - Document version history
- ✅ `project_members` - Project collaboration
- ✅ `comments` - Document comments
- ✅ `writing_sessions` - Writing session tracking

**Total Tables with RLS:** 85 tables

---

## Detailed Findings

### Part 1: RLS Coverage

#### Tables with RLS Enabled

```
Total tables with RLS: 85
Tables with policies: 85
Orphaned tables (RLS but no policies): 0
```

✅ **Result:** All tables with RLS enabled have appropriate policies. No security gaps.

#### Policy Distribution

| Operation | Policy Count | Percentage |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| SELECT    | 90          | 35%        |
| INSERT    | 59          | 23%        |
| UPDATE    | 51          | 20%        |
| DELETE    | 41          | 16%        |
| ALL       | 16          | 6%         |
| **Total** | **257**     | **100%**   |

✅ **Result:** Good distribution of policies across all CRUD operations.

---

### Part 2: User Data Isolation

#### Critical Tables - Policy Analysis

| Table | Policies | Uses auth.uid() | Uses user_id | Operations |
|-------|----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| `user_profiles` | 2 | ✅ 2 | 0 | SELECT, UPDATE |
| `projects` | 4 | ✅ 4 | ✅ 4 | DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE |
| `documents` | 8 | ✅ 8 | ✅ 8 | DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE |
| `ai_usage` | 2 | ✅ 2 | ✅ 2 | INSERT, SELECT |
| `manuscript_submissions` | 4 | ✅ 4 | ✅ 4 | DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE |
| `project_members` | 2 | ✅ 2 | ✅ 2 | ALL, SELECT |
| `api_requests` | 1 | ✅ 1 | ✅ 1 | SELECT |
| `writing_sessions` | 2 | ✅ 2 | ✅ 2 | ALL, SELECT |

✅ **Result:** All critical tables use `auth.uid()` or `user_id` checks for proper user isolation.

---

### Part 3: Anonymous Access Restrictions

#### Tables with Public SELECT Access

Found 2 tables with unrestricted SELECT for anonymous users:

1. **`partner_submission_stats`** - "Anyone can view partner stats"
   - **Justification:** ✅ Public analytics data (aggregated statistics only)
   - **Risk:** 🟢 Low - No sensitive user data exposed

2. **`template_usage_stats`** - "Anyone can read usage stats"
   - **Justification:** ✅ Public analytics data (template usage metrics)
   - **Risk:** 🟢 Low - No sensitive user data exposed

✅ **Result:** Only intentional public analytics tables are accessible. No security issue.

#### Sensitive Tables - Anonymous Access Test

| Table | Anonymous SELECT | Status |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| `user_profiles` | ❌ Denied | ✅ Secure |
| `projects` | ❌ Denied | ✅ Secure |
| `documents` | ❌ Denied | ✅ Secure |
| `ai_usage` | ❌ Denied | ✅ Secure |
| `manuscript_submissions` | ❌ Denied | ✅ Secure |
| `api_requests` | ❌ Denied | ✅ Secure |

✅ **Result:** All sensitive tables properly restrict anonymous access.

---

### Part 4: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE Policies

#### Policy Structure Analysis

All modifying operations follow security best practices:

**DELETE Policies:**
- ✅ All use `qual` (WHERE clause) to check ownership
- ✅ Pattern: `(auth.uid() = user_id)` or equivalent
- ✅ Users can only delete their own data

**UPDATE Policies:**
- ✅ All use `qual` to check ownership
- ✅ Pattern: `(auth.uid() = user_id)` or equivalent
- ✅ Users can only update their own data

**INSERT Policies:**
- ✅ All use `with_check` to validate new rows
- ✅ Pattern: `(auth.uid() = user_id)` in with_check
- ✅ Users can only insert data with their own user_id

**Exception Found:**
- Table: `change_notifications`
- Policy: "System can create change notifications"
- with_check: `true` (always allowed)
- **Status:** ✅ Intentional - System-generated notifications

✅ **Result:** All policies follow PostgreSQL security best practices.

---

### Part 5: Collaborator Access

#### Project Member Access Pattern

Tables using `project_members` for shared access:

- ✅ `projects` - Collaborators can view shared projects
- ✅ `documents` - Collaborators can access shared documents
- ✅ `comments` - Collaborators can comment on shared documents
- ✅ `comment_threads` - Collaborators can participate in discussions

#### Typical Policy Pattern

```sql
-- Example from documents table
SELECT FROM documents
WHERE (
  -- Owner can access
  auth.uid() = user_id
  OR
  -- Collaborators can access via project_members
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM project_members
    WHERE project_members.project_id = documents.project_id
      AND project_members.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
)
```

✅ **Result:** Proper multi-user collaboration support with security maintained.

---

### Part 6: Edge Cases

#### Edge Case 1: Document Branches
- ✅ Users can only delete non-main branches
- ✅ Prevents accidental deletion of main branch
- Policy: `(user_id = auth.uid() AND is_main = false)`

#### Edge Case 2: Document Changes
- ✅ Users can only delete pending changes (not approved)
- ✅ Prevents tampering with approved changes
- Policy: `(user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'pending')`

#### Edge Case 3: Nested Resources
- ✅ Scenes can only be created in user's own documents
- ✅ Uses EXISTS subquery to check document ownership
- Policy checks parent document access

#### Edge Case 4: Folder Hierarchies
- ✅ Folders can only be created in user's own projects
- ✅ Parent folder validation in with_check constraint

✅ **Result:** All edge cases properly handled with secure constraints.

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority
✅ **COMPLETED** - All high-priority security measures in place

### Medium Priority (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection** (Supabase Auth)
   - Go to: Auth → Settings → Password strength
   - Enable "Check against leaked passwords"
   - Uses HaveIBeenPwned.org API

2. **Add RLS Policies for Materialized Views** (if needed)
   - `submission_analytics_summary`
   - `partner_performance_analytics`
   - `genre_performance_analytics`
   - **Note:** These are analytics views, consider if data is sensitive

### Low Priority

3. **Implement Row-Level Audit Logging**
   - Track who accessed sensitive data
   - Log access to manuscripts and submissions
   - Consider for compliance requirements

4. **Add Rate Limiting Policies**
   - Prevent abuse of public analytics endpoints
   - Consider Supabase Edge Functions for rate limiting

## Known Limitations & Assumptions

### Assumptions Made

1. **Service Role Usage**
   - Assumption: Service role key is kept secure
   - Mitigation: Use Vercel environment variables (encrypted)

2. **Public Analytics Tables**
   - Assumption: Aggregated stats contain no sensitive data
   - Tables: `partner_submission_stats`, `template_usage_stats`

3. **Collaborator Trust**
   - Assumption: Project owners trust their collaborators
   - Mitigation: Role-based access (viewer/editor/admin)

### Limitations

1. **Function-Level Security**
   - RLS policies don't apply to `SECURITY DEFINER` functions
   - **Mitigation:** ✅ All SECURITY DEFINER functions have `SET search_path = ''` (see SUPABASE_SECURITY_FIXES.md)

2. **Materialized Views**
   - RLS policies don't apply to materialized views by default
   - **Status:** 3 materialized views exist for analytics
   - **Risk:** 🟢 Low - Only contain aggregated data

3. **Real-time Subscriptions**
   - RLS applies to real-time but can be bypassed with service role
   - **Mitigation:** Never expose service role key to client
