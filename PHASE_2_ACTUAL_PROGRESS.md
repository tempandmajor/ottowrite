- Mobile app
- Advanced integrations

---

## Success Metrics - Actual vs. Planned

### Planned Targets
- 70%+ users create character profiles
- 50%+ users use beat sheet
- 40%+ users run plot hole detection
- 60%+ users set writing goals

### Actual Capability
✅ Can track: Character creation
✅ Can track: Beat sheet usage
✅ Can track: Plot analysis runs
⏳ Cannot track: Writing goals (not implemented)

**Recommendation**: Set up analytics tracking for existing features before adding more.

---

## Conclusion

Phase 2 progress is strong but uneven:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Exceeded expectations with enhanced features
- **Weeks 3-4**: Strong delivery on core character system
- **Week 5**: World-building delivered early with bonus features
- **Weeks 6-8**: Not started yet

**Current Status**: 36% feature complete (6.5/18) but with significant quality enhancements that weren't in the original plan (UI/UX overhaul, advanced visualization, comprehensive documentation).

**Recommendation**: Choose Option B (Polish & QA) to ensure current features are production-ready before expanding further.
