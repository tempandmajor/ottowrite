# IP Protection Dashboard Implementation

**Ticket:** MS-3.4
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** P1
**Points:** 4

## Overview

Created a comprehensive IP Protection Dashboard that gives authors visibility into manuscript security and access patterns. The dashboard monitors DRM status, access logs, and suspicious activity across all manuscript submissions.

## Components Created

### Pages

1. **`app/dashboard/ip-protection/page.tsx`**
   - Main dashboard page with tabbed interface
   - Requires Studio subscription (same access level as submissions)
   - Three main tabs: Overview, Access Logs, Security Alerts

### Components

1. **`components/ip-protection/submission-security-overview.tsx`**
   - Security status cards for all submissions
   - Displays:
     - Total submissions and active count
     - Total accesses across all submissions
     - Protected submissions (with DRM)
     - Security alerts count
   - Per-submission details:
     - DRM and watermark status
     - Access statistics (views, partners, IPs)
     - Alert counts
     - Last accessed timestamp

2. **`components/ip-protection/access-timeline-chart.tsx`**
   - Visual timeline of manuscript access patterns
   - Features:
     - Time range selector (7d, 30d, 90d)
     - Daily access bar chart
     - Access type breakdown (query, synopsis, samples)
     - Top 5 most active partners
     - Summary statistics (total, average, peak day)

3. **`components/ip-protection/security-alerts-panel.tsx`**
   - Security alert management interface
   - Features:
     - Filter by severity (low, medium, high, critical)
     - Filter by status (new, investigating, confirmed, false positive, resolved)
     - Alert type indicators (rapid access, multiple devices, IP mismatch, etc.)
     - Alert resolution workflow with notes
     - Mark alerts as resolved or false positive

4. **`components/ip-protection/recent-access-logs.tsx`**
   - Detailed access log table
   - Columns:
     - Date & time
     - Submission title
     - Partner information
     - Action type (with icons)
     - Location (country + IP)
     - Session duration
     - Access status (granted/denied)
   - Pagination support (50 logs per page)
   - Action filtering

4. **`app/api/ip-protection/alerts/[alertId]/route.ts`** (PATCH)
   - Updates alert status and resolution notes
   - Validates alert ownership
   - Calls `update_alert_status` database function

### Navigation

Updated `components/dashboard/dashboard-nav.tsx`:
- Added "IP Protection" nav item with Shield icon
- Marked as Studio-exclusive feature
- Positioned between Submissions and Analytics

## Database Tables Used

The dashboard queries the following tables created in MS-3.3:

1. **`manuscript_submissions`** - Base submission data
2. **`manuscript_access_logs`** - Detailed access tracking
3. **`manuscript_access_summary`** - Aggregated view of access statistics
4. **`suspicious_activity_alerts`** - Security alerts
5. **`submission_partners`** - Partner information
6. **`partner_submissions`** - Junction table (for DRM/watermark status)

## Database Functions Used

1. **`update_alert_status()`** - Updates alert status with reviewer tracking

## Features

### Security Overview
- Real-time statistics on manuscript protection
- Visual indicators for DRM and watermark status
- Alert counters per submission
- Quick access to submission details

### Access Monitoring
- Timeline visualization of access patterns
- Breakdown by access type (query, synopsis, samples)
- Partner engagement tracking
- Geographic and IP tracking

### Security Alerts
- Automated detection of suspicious activity:
  - Rapid access (>10 accesses in 1 hour)
  - Multiple devices (>3 unique devices)
  - IP mismatch (>5 unique IPs)
  - Unusual locations
  - Unauthorized actions
- Severity classification (low, medium, high, critical)
- Alert management workflow
- Resolution tracking with notes

### Access Logs
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Filter by action type
- IP address and location tracking
- Session duration monitoring
- Access grant/deny status

## Access Control

- Requires Studio subscription (same as manuscript submissions)
- Row-level security via Supabase RLS policies
- Users can only view:
  - Their own submissions' access data
  - Alerts for their own submissions
  - Logs for their own submissions

## User Experience

### Empty States
- Helpful messages when no data exists
- Call-to-action to create first submission
- Clear explanations of what data will appear

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders for all components
- Smooth transitions when data loads

### Error Handling
- Graceful error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All endpoints verify user authentication
   - Return 401 if not authenticated

2. **Authorization Checks**
   - Verify submission ownership before returning data
   - Verify alert ownership before allowing updates

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Only show data for user's own submissions
   - Partner data limited to what's needed for context

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Standard API rate limiting applies
   - Pagination prevents excessive data loads

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export Functionality**
   - CSV export of access logs
   - PDF reports of security summaries

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Alert users when high/critical severity alerts occur
   - Weekly digest of access activity

3. **Advanced Filters**
   - Date range selection for access logs
   - Multi-select filtering
   - Search by partner name/email

4. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Engagement metrics per partner
   - Conversion tracking (view → request → accept)
   - Geographic heat maps

5. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket integration for live alerts
   - Live access notifications

## Testing

All endpoints require authentication, so testing should include:

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/ip-protection`
   - Verify Studio subscription check
   - Test all three tabs
   - Test filtering and pagination

2. **API Testing**
   - Test with valid authentication token
   - Test without authentication (should return 401)
   - Test with submissions that have access logs
   - Test with submissions that have alerts

3. **Edge Cases**
   - No submissions yet
   - Submissions with no access logs
   - Submissions with no alerts
   - Very large datasets (pagination)

## Files Changed

### New Files (9)
- `app/dashboard/ip-protection/page.tsx`
- `components/ip-protection/submission-security-overview.tsx`
- `components/ip-protection/access-timeline-chart.tsx`
- `components/ip-protection/security-alerts-panel.tsx`
- `components/ip-protection/recent-access-logs.tsx`

- `app/api/ip-protection/alerts/route.ts`
- `app/api/ip-protection/alerts/[alertId]/route.ts`
- `app/api/ip-protection/access-logs/route.ts`

### Modified Files (1)
- `components/dashboard/dashboard-nav.tsx` - Added IP Protection nav item

## Dependencies

All UI components use existing dependencies:
- `@radix-ui/react-tabs` - For tabbed interface
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog` - For alert resolution modal
- `@radix-ui/react-select` - For dropdowns
- `lucide-react` - For icons
- Existing UI component library (Button, Card, Badge, Table, Textarea, etc.)

## Deployment Notes

1. Database migrations must be applied first (MS-3.3)
2. No environment variables required
3. No additional npm packages needed
4. TypeScript compilation verified (no errors)
5. All endpoints use `errorResponses` helper for consistent error handling

## Success Metrics

- Authors can view all access to their manuscripts
- Security alerts are clearly visible and actionable
- Access patterns are easily visualized
- Dashboard loads quickly even with large datasets
- All data is properly protected by RLS policies
