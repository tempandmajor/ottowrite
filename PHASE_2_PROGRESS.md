## 🚀 User Experience

### Story Structure Workflow
1. User opens project
2. Clicks "Story Structure" button
3. Choose a template (Save the Cat, Hero's Journey, etc.)
4. System creates all beats automatically
5. User tracks progress beat-by-beat
6. Add notes to each beat
7. Mark beats as complete as they write

### Example: Save the Cat Template
```
Beat 1: Opening Image (Page 1, ~1%)
- A snapshot of the protagonist's life before the journey begins.

Beat 2: Theme Stated (Page 15, ~5%)
- The theme or lesson of the story is hinted at.

Beat 3: Setup (Page 30, ~10%)
- Introduce the protagonist's world, their wants, and their flaws.

...and so on through all 15 beats
```
