- created_at, updated_at

-- location_events table
- id, user_id, project_id, location_id
- title, occurs_at, description, importance
- key_characters[], tags[]
- created_at, updated_at

-- RLS policies for user-scoped access
-- Indexes for performance
```

**API Endpoints**:

## Migration Application

### Required Migration
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251017000010_world_building.sql`

**Application Method**:
1. Via Supabase Dashboard:
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Run migration contents

2. Via Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

3. Via MCP (if permissions allow):
   ```typescript
   mcp__supabase__apply_migration({
     project_id: "jtngociduoicfnieidxf",
     name: "world_building",
     query: "..."
   })
   ```

## Known Limitations

### World-Building Module
- **Timeline view**: Currently list-based, not visual timeline
- **Map integration**: No geographical mapping yet
- **Relationships**: Locations don't link to characters yet
- **Search**: Basic text search only (no fuzzy matching)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Visual timeline** with horizontal scrolling
2. **Map view** with geographical relationships
3. **Character-location links** (who's been where)
4. **Location hierarchies** (city within region)
5. **Import/export** world-building data
6. **Templates** for common location types
