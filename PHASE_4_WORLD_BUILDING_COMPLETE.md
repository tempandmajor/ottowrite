## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Timeline View**: List-based (not visual timeline)
2. **No Map Integration**: No geographical visualization
3. **No Character Links**: Characters not linked to locations
4. **Basic Search**: Text-only, no fuzzy matching
5. **No Templates**: Users start from scratch
6. **No Export**: Can't export location data

### Planned Enhancements

**Phase 1** (Next Sprint):
- Visual timeline UI with horizontal scrolling
- Location templates (tavern, castle, spaceship, etc.)
- Enhanced search with fuzzy matching

**Phase 2** (Q1 2026):
- Interactive map view with location pins
- Character-location relationship tracking
- Location hierarchies (city → region → continent)

**Phase 3** (Q2 2026):
- Export to PDF, markdown, JSON
- Import from other tools (Campfire, World Anvil)
- AI-powered location generation
