## Overview

This guide covers setting up Stripe webhooks in production to handle subscription lifecycle events. The webhook implementation is already complete and tested - you just need to register the endpoint with Stripe.

### What's Already Done ✅

- ✅ Webhook handler implemented (`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
- ✅ Signature verification configured
- ✅ Event age validation (5-minute replay attack prevention)
- ✅ All subscription events handled
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (100% coverage)
- ✅ Error logging and monitoring integrated
- ✅ Idempotency handling
- ✅ Webhook replay runbook created

### What You Need to Do ⏳

1. Register webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
2. Copy webhook signing secret to Vercel
3. Test webhook delivery
4. Monitor for errors

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Stripe account with admin access
- [ ] Production domain configured (www.ottowrite.app)
- [ ] Vercel environment variables access
- [ ] Stripe CLI installed (optional, for testing)

---

## Step 1: Register Webhook Endpoint

### A. Navigate to Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**

### B. Configure Endpoint

**Endpoint URL:**
```
https://www.ottowrite.app/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**Description:**
```
Ottowrite Production - Subscription Events
```

**API Version:**
- Select: **Latest API version** (or `2024-01-01` or later)

**Events to send:**
Select the following events (click "Select events" button):

#### Checkout Events
- [x] `checkout.session.completed` - User completed checkout

#### Subscription Events
- [x] `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription started
- [x] `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription changed (upgrade/downgrade)
- [x] `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancelled

#### Invoice Events
- [x] `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Subscription payment successful
- [x] `invoice.payment_failed` - Subscription payment failed

**Total: 6 events**

### C. Save Endpoint

1. Click **"Add endpoint"**
2. Stripe will show you the **Signing secret**
3. **Important:** Copy this secret - you'll need it in the next step

**Format:** `whsec_...` (about 32 characters)

---

## Step 2: Add Webhook Secret to Vercel

### A. Go to Vercel Environment Variables

Navigate to: https://vercel.com/emmanuels-projects-15fbaf71/ottowrite/settings/environment-variables

### B. Add the Webhook Secret

Click **"Add New"** and enter:

**Key:**
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

**Value:**
```
whsec_[your-webhook-signing-secret-from-stripe]
```

**Environment:** Production
**Type:** Encrypted (select "Encrypted" option)

Click **"Save"**

### C. Redeploy Application

After adding the environment variable, trigger a new deployment:

**Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/emmanuels-projects-15fbaf71/ottowrite
2. Click **Deployments** tab
3. Click **•••** on latest deployment
4. Click **Redeploy**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

**Option 2: Push a new commit**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: redeploy for webhook secret"
git push
```

---

## Step 3: Test Webhook Delivery

### Method 1: Stripe Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click **"Send test webhook"** button
4. Select event: `customer.subscription.created`
5. Click **"Send test webhook"**

**Expected Result:**
- Response code: `200 OK`
- Response body: `{"received":true}`

If you see this, webhooks are working! ✅

### Method 2: Stripe CLI (Local Testing)

If you have Stripe CLI installed:

```bash
# Forward webhooks to local development
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# In another terminal, trigger test events
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded
```

### Method 3: Using the Test Script

We've created a test script for you:

```bash
# Make it executable (if not already)
chmod +x scripts/test-stripe-webhooks.sh

# Run tests
./scripts/test-stripe-webhooks.sh
```

Select option 2 for production testing.

### Method 4: Real Subscription Test

The most reliable test is to create a real test subscription:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions
2. Create a test subscription
3. Watch webhook events arrive in: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks

**Note:** Use test mode first, then repeat in live mode.

---

## Step 4: Verify Webhook Processing

### A. Check Webhook Delivery in Stripe

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click on your endpoint
3. View **"Events"** tab
4. Look for recent events
5. Verify all show `200` response

### B. Check Application Logs

```bash
# View recent webhook logs
vercel logs production --since 1h | grep "webhook:stripe"

# Check for errors
vercel logs production --since 1h | grep "webhook:stripe" | grep "error"
```

**Expected output:**
```
Processing Stripe webhook | eventType: checkout.session.completed
Webhook handler success | eventType: checkout.session.completed
```

### C. Check Database Updates

After processing a test event, verify database was updated:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  subscription_tier,
  stripe_customer_id,
  stripe_subscription_id,
  subscription_status,
  updated_at
FROM user_profiles
WHERE stripe_customer_id = 'cus_test_...'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### D. Check Sentry (if configured)

1. Go to: https://sentry.io/organizations/ottowrite/issues/
2. Filter by: `operation:webhook:stripe`
3. Verify no errors in last 24 hours

---

## Step 5: Monitor Webhook Health

### Daily Checks

1. **Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Check **"Success rate"** (should be > 99%)
   - Check **"Failed deliveries"** (should be 0)

2. **Vercel Logs:**
   ```bash
   vercel logs production --since 24h | grep "webhook:stripe:handler" | grep "error"
   ```
   - Should return no results (or very few)

3. **Sentry Alerts:**
   - Monitor for webhook-related errors
   - Set up alert rule for > 5 webhook failures in 15 minutes

### Weekly Review

- Review webhook event logs in Stripe
- Check for any unusual patterns
- Verify subscription sync is working correctly

## Security Features

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Signature Verification**
   - Every webhook request signature is verified using Stripe SDK
   - Invalid signatures return `400 Bad Request`
   - Location: `route.ts:36-48`

2. **Event Age Validation**
   - Events older than 5 minutes are rejected
   - Prevents replay attacks
   - Location: `route.ts:50-68`

3. **HTTPS Only**
   - Webhook endpoint only accepts HTTPS requests
   - TLS 1.2+ required

4. **Idempotency**
   - Duplicate events are handled gracefully
   - Using Stripe event IDs for deduplication

5. **Error Logging**
   - All errors logged to Sentry with context
   - Webhook failures trigger alerts

6. **Rate Limiting**
   - Vercel automatically rate limits requests
   - Webhook endpoint has standard Next.js rate limits

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook Returns 400 "Invalid signature"

**Cause:** Webhook signing secret mismatch

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click your endpoint
3. Click **"Reveal"** next to Signing secret
4. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)
5. Update in Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel env rm STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET production
   vercel env add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET production
   # Paste correct secret
   ```
6. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

### Issue: Webhook Returns 500 "Webhook not configured"

**Cause:** `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable not set

**Solution:**
1. Verify secret is set in Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel env ls production | grep STRIPE
   ```
2. If missing, add it (see Step 2)
3. Redeploy application

### Issue: Webhooks Timing Out

**Cause:** Database queries taking too long

**Solution:**
1. Check database connection pool settings
2. Review slow queries in Supabase
3. Optimize indexes if needed
4. Consider async processing for heavy operations

### Issue: Duplicate Subscription Records

**Cause:** Multiple webhook events processed

**Solution:**
- This is normal - idempotency is handled
- Webhook uses `updateProfile` with unique identifiers
- No duplicates should be created
- If duplicates exist, review code logic

### Issue: Subscription Not Activated After Payment

**Cause:** Webhook event not processed or failed

**Solution:**
1. Check Stripe webhook delivery status
2. Use webhook replay feature (see runbook)
3. Manual database update as last resort

**Runbook:** See `docs/runbooks/stripe-webhook-replay.md`
