## Database Schema

### Updated Tables

#### partner_submissions
Enhanced with response tracking fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE partner_submissions (
  -- ... existing fields

  -- Partner Response (MS-4.4)
  partner_response TEXT,
  partner_response_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  rejection_reason TEXT,
  rejection_category TEXT CHECK (rejection_category IN (
    'not_fit_for_list',
    'writing_needs_work',
    'story_not_ready',
    'market_reasons',
    'other'
  )),

  -- Status tracking
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN (
    'draft',
    'submitted',
    'under_review',
    'sample_requested',
    'full_requested',
    'accepted',
    'rejected',
    'withdrawn'
  ))
);
```

**Response Status Flow:**
```
submitted → viewed → under_review
                  ↓
                  ├→ sample_requested → full_requested → accepted
                  ├→ rejected
                  └→ requested_more (more materials)
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/partners/submissions

Fetch submissions for authenticated partner.

**Query Parameters:**
- `partner_id` (required): Partner UUID

      "title": "The Great Adventure",
      "genre": "Fantasy",
      "word_count": 95000,
      "author_name": "John Doe",
      "submitted_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "status": "submitted",
      "query_letter_preview": "Dear Agent..."
    }
  ],
  "total": 5

## Notification System Integration

### Notification Helpers

Located in `lib/notifications/create-notification.ts`:

#### notifyResponseReceived()
**Triggered when:** Partner sends any response (requested_more, under_review, etc.)

```typescript
notifyResponseReceived(
  userId: string,
  submissionId: string,
  submissionTitle: string,
  partnerName: string
)
```

**Creates:**
- Type: `response_received`
- Title: "Response received"
- Message: `${partnerName} sent a response for "${submissionTitle}"`
- Action URL: `/dashboard/submissions/${submissionId}`

#### notifySubmissionAccepted()
**Triggered when:** Partner accepts submission

```typescript
notifySubmissionAccepted(
  userId: string,
  submissionId: string,
  submissionTitle: string,
  partnerName: string
)
```

**Creates:**
- Type: `status_accepted`
- Title: "Congratulations! Submission accepted"
- Message: `${partnerName} accepted "${submissionTitle}"! 🎉`
- Action URL: `/dashboard/submissions/${submissionId}`

#### notifySubmissionRejected()
**Triggered when:** Partner rejects submission

```typescript
notifySubmissionRejected(
  userId: string,
  submissionId: string,
  submissionTitle: string,
  partnerName: string
)
```

**Creates:**
- Type: `status_rejected`
- Title: "Submission status update"
- Message: `${partnerName} passed on "${submissionTitle}"`
- Action URL: `/dashboard/submissions/${submissionId}`

### Notification Flow

1. Partner submits response via form
2. API updates `partner_submissions` table
3. API calls appropriate notification helper based on status
4. Notification is created in `submission_notifications` table
5. Author sees notification badge in real-time (30s polling)
6. Author clicks notification to view submission details
7. Author sees partner response in `PartnerResponsesList` component

## Author-Facing Components

### PartnerResponsesList (`components/submissions/partner-responses-list.tsx`)

Displays all partner responses for a submission.

**Features:**
- Fetches from `/api/submissions/[submissionId]/partners`
- Shows all partners contacted for submission
- Response status badges with color coding
- View tracking (first viewed, last viewed, view count)
- Partner response text display
- Response date with formatting
- Partner profile links
- Empty states (no partners contacted, awaiting responses)

**Integration:**
Used in `SubmissionDetailView` component on "Partner Responses" tab.

**File:** `components/submissions/partner-responses-list.tsx`

## Security & Access Control

### Row Level Security (RLS)

#### Partner Access
```sql
-- Partners can view submissions sent to them
CREATE POLICY "Partners can view submissions sent to them"
  ON partner_submissions FOR SELECT
  USING (
    partner_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM submission_partners
      WHERE email = auth.jwt()->>'email'
    )
  );
```

#### Author Access
```sql
-- Users can view their own partner submissions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own partner submissions"
  ON partner_submissions FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Partner Verification

**Email-Based Authentication:**
- Partner portal uses Supabase auth email
- Email must match `submission_partners.email` field
- Verified in every API call and page load
- No password sharing - each partner has unique account

**Access Checks:**
1. User must be authenticated
2. User email must match partner record
3. Partner must be verified (`verified = true`)
4. Partner status must be `active`

## Response Status Definitions

### Status Types

| Status | Description | Who Sets | Notification | Author Action |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| `submitted` | Initial state when author sends | System | - | Wait for response |
| `viewed` | Partner has opened the submission | Partner | - | No action needed |
| `under_review` | Partner is actively reviewing | Partner | response_received | Wait |
| `sample_requested` | Partner wants sample pages | Partner | response_received | Upload samples |
| `full_requested` | Partner wants full manuscript | Partner | response_received | Upload full MS |
| `requested_more` | Partner needs more materials | Partner | response_received | Provide materials |
| `accepted` | Partner accepts/offers representation | Partner | status_accepted | Celebrate! 🎉 |
| `rejected` | Partner passes on submission | Partner | status_rejected | Try other partners |
| `withdrawn` | Author withdraws submission | Author | - | - |

### Response Categories

For rejections, optional categorization:
- `not_fit_for_list` - Not a good match for partner's list
- `writing_needs_work` - Writing quality needs improvement
- `story_not_ready` - Story/concept not fully developed
- `market_reasons` - Market conditions/timing issues
- `other` - Other reasons

2. **Review Feedback Quality** - Flag inappropriate responses
3. **Track Acceptance Rates** - Identify successful partnerships
4. **Enforce Confidentiality** - Investigate watermark breaches
5. **Update Partner Verification** - Keep partner list current

## Troubleshooting

### Partner Cannot Access Dashboard

**Symptom:** "Partner Access Required" message
**Causes:**
- Email not in `submission_partners` table
- Partner account not verified
- Partner status not `active`

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check partner record
SELECT * FROM submission_partners WHERE email = 'partner@example.com';

-- Verify partner
UPDATE submission_partners
SET verified = true, verification_date = NOW()
WHERE email = 'partner@example.com';
```

### Author Not Receiving Notifications

**Symptom:** No notification appears after partner response
**Causes:**
- Notification preferences disabled
- Database error during notification creation
- RLS policy blocking notification view

**Solution:**
1. Check notification preferences: `/dashboard/submissions/preferences`
2. Verify notification created: Check `submission_notifications` table
3. Check console logs for errors in response API

### Response Not Updating

**Symptom:** Response form submits but submission status unchanged
**Causes:**
- Partner ownership verification failed
- Database update error
- RLS policy blocking update

**Solution:**
1. Verify partner email matches `submission_partners.email`
2. Check API logs for error details
3. Verify RLS policies on `partner_submissions` table
