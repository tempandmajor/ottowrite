- `partner_submissions`: Partner counts, view tracking, status aggregation, response data
- Join queries: partner_submissions + submission_partners for enriched partner data

### Access Control
- All endpoints verify user authentication
- Ownership verified via `user_id` foreign key
- RLS policies enforced on all table queries
- No cross-user data access possible

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Empty States
- Dashboard: "Create Your First Submission" CTA
- Partner responses: "Select Partners" CTA with explanation
- Activity timeline: N/A (always has creation event)

### Status Badges

- Capitalized display text
- Consistent styling across components

### Partner Status Badges
Color-coded by response status:
- Submitted: blue

- Sample Requested: amber
- Full Requested: orange
- Accepted: green
- Rejected: red

### Statistics Display
- Card-based layout
- Icon + label + value format
- Percentage displays for rates
