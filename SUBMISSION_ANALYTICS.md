## Analytics Metrics Explained

### Core Metrics

**Acceptance Rate:** `(Total Acceptances / Total Responses) * 100`
- Industry average: ~5-10%
- Good rate: >15%
- Excellent rate: >20%

**View Rate:** `(Total Views / Total Partners) * 100`
- Indicates targeting effectiveness
- Good rate: >60%
- Excellent rate: >80%

**Request Rate:** `(Total Requests / Total Views) * 100`
- Indicates material quality
- Good rate: >20%
- Excellent rate: >30%

### Conversion Funnel

Standard funnel progression:
1. **Partners Contacted** (100%)
2. **Viewed by Partner** (typically 50-70%)
3. **Material Requested** (typically 15-30% of views)
4. **Response Received** (typically 90%+ of requests)
5. **Accepted** (typically 5-15% of responses)

### Performance Score

Weighted calculation:
- **30%** View Rate (targeting)
- **30%** Request Rate (materials)
- **40%** Acceptance Rate (manuscript quality)

Score ranges:
